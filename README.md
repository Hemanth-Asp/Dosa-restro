## Instructions over how to Contribute.

**Step 1. Install Git/ Github in your system.** Fork the repository: This step creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hemanth-Asp/Dosa-restro.git
cd Dosa_Restro
```

**Step 2 . Create a new branch:** It's recommended to create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your changes separate from the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

**Step 3. Make and commit your changes:** Write your code or make the necessary modifications to the files in the repository. Once you're done, commit your changes with a meaningful message describing the changes you made.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my contribution"
```

**Step 4. Sync with the original repository:** Keep your forked repository in sync with the original repository to incorporate any recent changes made by other contributors.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Hemanth-Asp/Dosa-restro.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

**Step 5. Push your changes and create a pull request:** Push your branch with the committed changes to your forked repository. Then, create a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository.


```bash
git push origin my-branch
```

After pushing your changes, you can visit the original repository's page on GitHub or the respective hosting platform. From there, you can create a pull request by following the prompts.
